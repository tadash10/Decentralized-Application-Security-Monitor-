There are several functions that could improve the security monitoring script for decentralized applications on a Kubernetes cluster. Here are some suggestions:

    Implementing machine learning or AI algorithms to detect anomalies and suspicious behavior in the blockchain data.

    Integrating with external security tools and services, such as vulnerability scanners and threat intelligence platforms.

    Adding support for multiple blockchains and decentralized platforms, not just limited to Ethereum.

    Providing more detailed alerts and reports to security teams, including the root cause analysis of detected vulnerabilities.

    Implementing a comprehensive access control mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access the monitoring system.

    Adding support for real-time monitoring and alerting, instead of relying on periodic scans.

    Providing an easy-to-use dashboard or web interface to view and manage the monitoring results.

    Implementing secure communication protocols, such as TLS, to ensure that all communication between the monitoring system and the Kubernetes cluster is encrypted and secure.

    Integrating with Kubernetes native security features, such as PodSecurityPolicies and NetworkPolicies, to enhance the overall security posture of the cluster.

    Ensuring that the script is regularly updated and tested against the latest security threats and vulnerabilities.
